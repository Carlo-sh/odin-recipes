# odin-recipes

This project - first in the TOP curriculum - is about building a basic 
website of cooking recipes, implementing the html and css skills learned so far.

It basically consists of three static html pages, each displaying a recipe for
a unique dish.

The project will be resumed later in the curriculum to further improve the site
appearence.
