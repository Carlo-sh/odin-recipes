    <h2>A really tasty italian meat dish.</h2>
    <p>
      <i>
        Sometimes called veal Marsala, this is the classic Italian dish made
        with thinly sliced veal scaloppine. It's a recipe typical of Sicily,
        where the best Marsala comes from. Serve with plenty of bread to mop up
        the sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅓ pounds veal medallions</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup Marsala wine</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place veal between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface;
        pound to 1/4-inch thickness with the smooth side of a meat mallet. Pat
        dry with a paper towel and dust with flour on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter with olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat until it
        starts to foam. Add veal; cook until browned, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
        Season with salt. Transfer veal to a plate. Cover with aluminum foil to
        keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour Marsala wine into the same skillet. Stir to scrape up browned bits
        from the bottom of the skillet, about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir water and cornstarch together in a small bowl until cornstarch
        dissolves. Stir into the Marsala wine in the skillet. Season with salt
        and pepper. Cook until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return veal to the skillet; cook until heated through, about 1 minute.
        Remove from heat and serve topped with sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
